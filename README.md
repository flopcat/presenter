## Presenter

A simple tool for automating auxillary projector effects during conferences,
presentations, etc.

Presenter is designed to (sometimes) display things in front of other
applications, such as powerpoint, gallery viewers, and so on.  The other
application provides an opening image, wallpaper backgrounds, and/or so on,
while Presenter overlays external things not part of the other application.

Some applications may hide their window (such as exclusive mode windows) when
other windows are on their screen, leading to strange glitches or the need to
manually refocus their presentation window.  This may or may not apply to you.

### Effects

- Window opacity crossfades
- Countdowns to a particular time
- External image display
